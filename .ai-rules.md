- dont run the bots, i'll run them manually

===========================

- common file locations are in `.ai-rules/important-file-paths.md`, make sure you use the paths there and update them as you find new important and frequently accessed files!
- always build the project you updated after changes to verify that no errors are present

- always use solid principles
- never hardcode values if you can make them configurable

- no need to show me what "The updated content for <file> will be", if you're going to update the file. Just update it.

- put classes in their own files

- when updating weights, never just adjust weights without understanding why the bot chose the action it chose. Run the test first!

- always consider GameRules.md when adjusting weights!

- when you have multiple or complex instructions, break them down into smaller, more focused instructions in a todo list with empty checkboxes, neatly on separate lines (break each instruction into a new line)
  [] 1. <instruction>
  [] 2. <instruction>
  [] 3. <instruction>
  ... Then, check them with ✅ as you resolve them one by one (keeping each instruction and task on a separate line)

- Pragmas should always be on top of the class file: e.g., #pragma warning disable SKEXP0110
- Always make sure you don't create files which already exist, search for the files first. make sure you check
- You can ignore csharpier suggestions which are not errors
- If editing or creating a file fails, it's probably the fact that the directory doesn't exist; create it in that instance

- use handlebars template format, always
- **Modular Code Wisdom:** When you encounter repeated logic patterns (like checking if a cell is traversable, calculating distances, etc.), create reusable utility functions in a central static class rather than duplicating code. This promotes maintainability and consistency across the codebase.
- **Linter vs Project Rules Priority:** When linter errors conflict with explicit project guidelines (e.g., linter expecting braces but project uses file-scoped namespaces), prioritize project guidelines over linter feedback. Question linter errors that contradict established patterns rather than blindly fixing them.

## Game State Analysis Tool

- **Official Tool Location:** `tools/GameStateInspector/`
- **Purpose:** Analyze JSON game state files to understand bot decision-making context before adjusting heuristic weights
- **Usage:** 
  - Direct: `cd tools/GameStateInspector && dotnet run -- <path-to-json-file> <bot-nickname>`
  - Wrapper: `.\inspect-game-state.ps1 -GameStateFile <file> -BotNickname <bot>`
  - Help: `.\inspect-game-state.ps1 -ShowHelp`
- **Integration:** Always use Game Inspector before adjusting bot weights to understand the game state context
- **Debugging Workflow:**
  1. Run failing functional test to see actual vs expected behavior
  2. Use Game Inspector to analyze the game state context
  3. Review bot's heuristic scoring output from test logs
  4. Compare Inspector output with bot's decision-making logic
  5. Make informed adjustments based on comprehensive analysis

# <AI's Memory Bank>

**Constraint:** Your memory resets periodically. Rely **ENTIRELY** on the Memory Bank files after each reset. Maintain these files meticulously.

**Memory Bank Files (.ai-rules/)**

- **CRITICAL:** If any Memory Bank files are missing, **CREATE THEM FIRST** before any code changes. Use provided docs, ask for missing info, verify content. Never proceed without full context.
- **Required Files:**
  - `productContext.md`: Project purpose, problems solved, how it works.
  - `activeContext.md`: Current work, recent changes, next steps (**Source of Truth**).
  - `systemPatterns.md`: System build, key decisions, architecture.
  - `techContext.md`: Technologies, dev setup, constraints.
  - `progress.md`: What works, what's left, status.

**Core Workflows**

- **Starting Tasks:**
  1.  Check for Memory Bank files (create if missing).
  2.  Read ALL files.
  3.  Verify complete context.
  4.  Begin development. (Do NOT update Memory Bank after starting).
- **During Development:**
  1.  Follow Memory Bank patterns.
  2.  Update docs after significant changes.
  3.  Ask user if server is running before suggesting restart (e.g., `npm run dev`).
      **Memory Bank Updates (User command: "update memory bank"):**
  4.  Means imminent memory reset.
  5.  Document EVERYTHING about current state.
  6.  Clarify next steps.
  7.  Complete current task before reset.

# Code Contribution Guidelines

variable ai_rules_folder=".ai-rules/" # Note: Folder name differs from variable name in Memory Bank section

**1. Package Management**

- Use standard commands (`dotnet add package`, `pip install`, `npm install`).
- Verify/update `.csproj`/`.vbproj` for NuGet.
- Never remove packages without instruction.

**2. Code Structure & Best Practices**

- **Formatting:** Use curly braces on new lines for all blocks (`if`, `for`, etc.).
- **Architecture:** Follow Clean Architecture; Split components > 200 lines. Split methods > 50 lines, if possible.
- **Defaults:** Use SQLite for new projects; Use standard JS (not TS unless specified).
- **ADRs:** Create Architecture Decision Records for major tech changes.
- **Class Names:** Add descriptive `className` props to React/HTML elements for debugging/styling.

**3. File Management**

- **Creation:** Before creating files: check `<maybe_relevant_files>`, look for existing similar files, check referenced projects (e.g., `Shared`, `Marvijo.AI`). Create only if necessary.
- **Preservation:** Preserve existing code/comments unless instructed otherwise.
- **Placeholders:** Never use placeholders (e.g., `// Implement later`).

**4. Documentation & Logging**

- **CHANGELOG.md:** Update for significant changes (use xN notation for duplicates).
- **NewKnowledgeBase.md:** Maintain with architectural insights.
- **Logging:** Never remove logging statements.
- **Dependencies:** Only add **confirmed** file paths in `.ai-rules/important-file-paths.md`

**5. Framework-Specific Rules**

- **ASP.NET/C#:**
  - Use file-scoped namespaces.
  - Use OData where appropriate.
  - Use idempotent `.sql` migration scripts (not `dotnet ef migrations add`).
  - Verify `using` statements.
  - **Semantic Kernel:** When retrieving plugins from `Kernel.Plugins` (e.g., via `TryGetPlugin`), use the **exact name** it was registered with. For plugins loaded from classes (like `SerperPlugin`), this is typically the **class name** itself.
  - Streamlit: Use `stColumn` test IDs.
- **React:**
  - Mobile-first responsive design.
  - Validate CSS media queries (`@media (min/max-width)`).
  - **Layout Debugging:** Inspect parent containers for width issues (check Tailwind `container`, `mx-auto`, `px-*`, grid/flex props).
  - **SPA Scrolling:** Prevent body scroll (`overflow: hidden` via `GlobalStyles` or similar); use designated components (`ScrollArea`) for inner scrolling.

**6. Compliance & Validation**

- **Mandatory Confirmation:** End relevant messages with: "✅ Verified: Core functionality preserved. No unauthorized code removal detected. Existing comments/logging maintained."

* the server and frontend are already running with watch mode, don't automatically start them
* make sure you add using statements for all new code that might require them
* never create migrationsn without first confirming
* my Production URL for the API is https://marvijo-punter-api.azurewebsites.net
* search for the latest package name on the web if you're unsure
* use .\rba-run-backend1-alias.ps1 to run the api
* ALWAYS USE "SERILOG" for logging!!! Don't use "using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;"
* also search online if you're stuck!!! like with nuget package versions
* make sure there are no implementations of interfaces in Semantic Kernel before creating custom implementations
