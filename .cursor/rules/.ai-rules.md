- dont run the bots, i'll run them manually

===========================

- common file locations are in `.ai-rules/important-file-paths.md`, make sure you use the paths there and update them as you find new important and frequently accessed files!

- when you have multiple or complex instructions, break them down into smaller, more focused instructions in a todo list with empty checkboxes, neatly on separate lines (break each instruction into a new line)
  [] 1. <instruction>
  [] 2. <instruction>
  [] 3. <instruction>
  ... Then, check them with ✅ as you resolve them one by one (keeping each instruction and task on a separate line)

- Pragmas should always be on top of the class file: e.g., #pragma warning disable SKEXP0110
- Always make sure you don't create files which already exist, search for the files first. make sure you check
- You can ignore csharpier suggestions which are not errors
- If editing or creating a file fails, it's probably the fact that the directory doesn't exist; create it in that instance

- use handlebars template format, always

# <AI's Memory Bank>

**Constraint:** Your memory resets periodically. Rely **ENTIRELY** on the Memory Bank files after each reset. Maintain these files meticulously.

**Memory Bank Files (.ai-rules/)**

- **CRITICAL:** If any Memory Bank files are missing, **CREATE THEM FIRST** before any code changes. Use provided docs, ask for missing info, verify content. Never proceed without full context.
- **Required Files:**
  - `productContext.md`: Project purpose, problems solved, how it works.
  - `activeContext.md`: Current work, recent changes, next steps (**Source of Truth**).
  - `systemPatterns.md`: System build, key decisions, architecture.
  - `techContext.md`: Technologies, dev setup, constraints.
  - `progress.md`: What works, what's left, status.

**Core Workflows**

- **Starting Tasks:**
  1.  Check for Memory Bank files (create if missing).
  2.  Read ALL files.
  3.  Verify complete context.
  4.  Begin development. (Do NOT update Memory Bank after starting).
- **During Development:**
  1.  Follow Memory Bank patterns.
  2.  Update docs after significant changes.
  3.  Ask user if server is running before suggesting restart (e.g., `npm run dev`).
      **Memory Bank Updates (User command: "update memory bank"):**
  4.  Means imminent memory reset.
  5.  Document EVERYTHING about current state.
  6.  Clarify next steps.
  7.  Complete current task before reset.

# Code Contribution Guidelines

variable ai_rules_folder=".ai-rules/" # Note: Folder name differs from variable name in Memory Bank section

**1. Package Management**

- Use standard commands (`dotnet add package`, `pip install`, `npm install`).
- Verify/update `.csproj`/`.vbproj` for NuGet.
- Never remove packages without instruction.

**2. Code Structure & Best Practices**

- **Formatting:** Use curly braces on new lines for all blocks (`if`, `for`, etc.).
- **Architecture:** Follow Clean Architecture; Split components > 200 lines. Split methods > 50 lines, if possible.
- **Defaults:** Use SQLite for new projects; Use standard JS (not TS unless specified).
- **ADRs:** Create Architecture Decision Records for major tech changes.
- **Class Names:** Add descriptive `className` props to React/HTML elements for debugging/styling.

**3. File Management**

- **Creation:** Before creating files: check `<maybe_relevant_files>`, look for existing similar files, check referenced projects (e.g., `Shared`, `Marvijo.AI`). Create only if necessary.
- **Preservation:** Preserve existing code/comments unless instructed otherwise.
- **Placeholders:** Never use placeholders (e.g., `// Implement later`).

**4. Documentation & Logging**

- **CHANGELOG.md:** Update for significant changes (use xN notation for duplicates).
- **NewKnowledgeBase.md:** Maintain with architectural insights.
- **Logging:** Never remove logging statements.
- **Dependencies:** Only add **confirmed** file paths in `.ai-rules/important-file-paths.md`

**5. Framework-Specific Rules**

- **ASP.NET/C#:**
  - Use file-scoped namespaces.
  - Use OData where appropriate.
  - Use idempotent `.sql` migration scripts (not `dotnet ef migrations add`).
  - Verify `using` statements.
  - **Semantic Kernel:** When retrieving plugins from `Kernel.Plugins` (e.g., via `TryGetPlugin`), use the **exact name** it was registered with. For plugins loaded from classes (like `SerperPlugin`), this is typically the **class name** itself.
  - Streamlit: Use `stColumn` test IDs.
- **React:**
  - Mobile-first responsive design.
  - Validate CSS media queries (`@media (min/max-width)`).
  - **Layout Debugging:** Inspect parent containers for width issues (check Tailwind `container`, `mx-auto`, `px-*`, grid/flex props).
  - **SPA Scrolling:** Prevent body scroll (`overflow: hidden` via `GlobalStyles` or similar); use designated components (`ScrollArea`) for inner scrolling.

**6. Compliance & Validation**

- **Mandatory Confirmation:** End relevant messages with: "✅ Verified: Core functionality preserved. No unauthorized code removal detected. Existing comments/logging maintained."

* the server and frontend are already running with watch mode, don't automatically start them
* make sure you add using statements for all new code that might require them
* never create migrationsn without first confirming
* my Production URL for the API is https://marvijo-punter-api.azurewebsites.net
* search for the latest package name on the web if you're unsure
* use .\rba-run-backend1-alias.ps1 to run the api
* ALWAYS USE "SERILOG" for logging!!! Don't use "using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;"
* also search online if you're stuck!!! like with nuget package versions
* make sure there are no implementations of interfaces in Semantic Kernel before creating custom implementations
