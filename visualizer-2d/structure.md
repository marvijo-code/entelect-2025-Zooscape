# Zooscape 2D Visualizer Layout Structure

## Updated Layout (Final)
- The grid now fills the ENTIRE left side by itself
- All controls (header, tick info, playback) moved to the right panel

## Component Hierarchy & Layout

```

└── split-layout (100vh)
    │
    ├── left-panel (100vh, 3/4 width)
    │   │
    │   └── grid-content (fills entire left panel)
    │       └── Grid component (fills entire space)
    │
    └── right-panel (100vh, 1/4 width)
        │
        ├── app-header (40px height)
        │   └── title and mode switch buttons
        │
        ├── grid-header (tick info and game status)

            └── tab content (Leaderboard/GameSelector/ConnectionDebugger)
```

## Key Layout Fixes Implemented

1. **Grid-Only Left Panel**:
   - The left panel now contains ONLY the grid-content, which fills 100% of its space
   - No header or controls taking up space on the left side
   - Grid fully utilizes the entire left 3/4 of the screen

2. **All Controls on Right Panel**:
   - Header, grid info, and playback controls all moved to the right panel
   - Right panel elements stack vertically in a logical order
   - Each control is separated by borders for clear visual distinction

3. **Improved Component Flow**:
   - Clear separation of grid display and interactive controls
   - Grid maximizes available screen real estate
   - Controls organized for better user experience on the right side

4. **Layout Flexibility**:
   - This design provides maximum space for the grid to display the game
   - Controls are consolidated in one area for easier access
   - The layout is clean and focused on the primary visual content

This new structure ensures the grid truly fills the entire left side from top to bottom, with all other UI elements contained within the right panel, creating a clear separation of content and controls.
