# Progress

## What's Working

- **Connection & Registration:** The bot reliably connects to the game server, handling startup race conditions with a retry mechanism.
- **Game State Parsing:** The bot now fully and correctly parses the game state JSON from the server.
  - It correctly handles `lowercase` keys converted by the SignalR client.
  - It dynamically calculates grid dimensions.
  - It correctly populates the `animal`, `zookeeper`, `wallBoard`, `pelletBoard`, and `powerUpBoard` data structures.
- **Core Game Logic:**
  - The bot can locate itself in the list of animals.
  - The `isTraversable` check correctly uses the `wallBoard`, allowing the bot to identify valid moves.
- **MCTS Engine:** The MCTS engine is expanding nodes and selecting actions.
- **Command Sending:** The bot successfully sends commands to the server, which are now correctly interpreted. The C++/C# SignalR serialization issue has been resolved.
- **Build System:** The `CMakeLists.txt` is correctly configured, and the project builds successfully.

## What's Left

- **Gameplay Verification:** Thoroughly test and observe the `AdvancedMCTSBot`'s gameplay to ensure it makes reasonable moves, operates within the 200ms time limit per move, and plays effectively.
- **Identify & Fix Gameplay Bugs:** Address any remaining bugs or performance issues in its decision-making process.
- **Address Minor Warnings:** The `heldPowerUp` null value warning should be investigated and resolved if it proves to be problematic. (Lower priority)
- **Logging Cleanup:** Review and remove or comment out any remaining temporary diagnostic logs for a clean production build. (Lower priority)

## Status

- **Current Phase:** Gameplay Verification and Refinement.
- **Immediate Next Action:** Observe the `AdvancedMCTSBot` playing in the game.
- **Confidence:** High. Major blockers (MCTS expansion, command sending) have been resolved.
