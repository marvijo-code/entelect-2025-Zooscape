# Progress

## What's Working

- **Connection & Registration:** The bot reliably connects to the game server, handling startup race conditions with a retry mechanism.
- **Game State Parsing:** The bot now fully and correctly parses the game state JSON from the server.
  - It correctly handles `lowercase` keys converted by the SignalR client.
  - It dynamically calculates grid dimensions.
  - It correctly populates the `animal`, `zookeeper`, `wallBoard`, `pelletBoard`, and `powerUpBoard` data structures.
- **Core Game Logic:**
  - The bot can locate itself in the list of animals.
  - The `isTraversable` check correctly uses the `wallBoard`, allowing the bot to identify valid moves.
- **Build System:** The `CMakeLists.txt` is correctly configured, and the project builds successfully.

## What's Left

- **Final Verification:** Run the bot and analyze the logs to confirm that the MCTS engine is now expanding nodes and selecting diverse, intelligent actions.
- **Address Minor Warnings:** The `heldPowerUp` null value warning should be investigated and resolved if it proves to be problematic.
- **Logging Cleanup:** All temporary diagnostic logs should be removed or commented out for a clean production build.

## Status

- **Current Phase:** Final Verification.
- **Immediate Next Action:** Run the bot and observe its behavior.
- **Confidence:** High. The root causes of the previous failures have been identified and fixed.
