# Progress

## What Works

- **`AdvancedMCTSBot` Compilation:** All identified C++ compilation errors (C2248, C2679, C2512, C2601, C1075) in `Bot.cpp` and `GameState.h` have been resolved.
- **`AdvancedMCTSBot` Linker Configuration:** `CMakeLists.txt` has been updated to include necessary `.cpp` source files (`GameState.cpp`, `MCTSEngine.cpp`, `MctsService.cpp`, and tentatively `Heuristics.cpp`, `MCTSNode.cpp`, `SignalRClient.cpp`) and remove header files from the `add_executable` target. This is expected to resolve the previously encountered linker errors (LNK2019, LNK2001, LNK1120).
- Other bots and the game engine are assumed to be functional as per previous states.

## What's Left

- **`AdvancedMCTSBot` Build Verification:**
    - Run the CMake build command (`cmake --build build --preset x64-debug > terminal.log 2>&1`) for `AdvancedMCTSBot`.
    - Confirm that CMake configures correctly (i.e., all specified `.cpp` files exist).
    - Confirm that the project compiles and links without any errors (check `terminal.log`).
- **Address Potential New Issues:** If the build fails due to non-existent assumed `.cpp` files or new errors, these will need to be addressed.
- **`AdvancedMCTSBot` Functional Testing:** Once a clean build is achieved, perform basic runtime tests.

## Status

- **Current Phase:** Build System Correction & Verification for `AdvancedMCTSBot`.
- **Immediate Next Action:** Attempting to build `AdvancedMCTSBot` after `CMakeLists.txt` modifications.
- **Confidence:** High that compilation errors are fixed. Medium that linker errors are fixed (dependent on existence of assumed `.cpp` files).
