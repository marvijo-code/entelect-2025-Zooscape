# Progress

## What's Working

-   **C++ Functional Test:** The `AdvancedMCTSBot_SmokeTest34` test now runs and passes successfully, validating the bot's MCTS logic against a challenging game state.
-   **MCTS Engine:** The engine provides varied and reasonable scores for the `34.json` scenario, unlike the trivial `162.json` case.
-   **Build System:** The CMake configuration can successfully build and run specific test targets when explicitly commanded.

## What's Left

-   **Compiler Warnings:** Identify and resolve the `C4244` and `C4267` data conversion warnings in the C++ codebase.
-   **Multi-threading:** Investigate and fix the suspected race condition in the MCTS engine that prevents simulations from running under short, multi-threaded time limits.
-   **Build Configuration:** Improve `CMakeLists.txt` so that test executables are included in the default build (`cmake --build .`) without needing to be specified as explicit targets (`--target <test_name>`).

## What Works

- **`AdvancedMCTSBot` Compilation:** All identified C++ compilation errors (C2248, C2679, C2512, C2601, C1075) in `Bot.cpp` and `GameState.h` have been resolved.
- **`AdvancedMCTSBot` Linker Configuration:** `CMakeLists.txt` has been updated to include necessary `.cpp` source files (`GameState.cpp`, `MCTSEngine.cpp`, `MctsService.cpp`, and tentatively `Heuristics.cpp`, `MCTSNode.cpp`, `SignalRClient.cpp`) and remove header files from the `add_executable` target. This is expected to resolve the previously encountered linker errors (LNK2019, LNK2001, LNK1120).
- Other bots and the game engine are assumed to be functional as per previous states.

## What's Left

- **`AdvancedMCTSBot` Build Verification:**
    - Run the CMake build command (`cmake --build build --preset x64-debug > terminal.log 2>&1`) for `AdvancedMCTSBot`.
    - Confirm that CMake configures correctly (i.e., all specified `.cpp` files exist).
    - Confirm that the project compiles and links without any errors (check `terminal.log`).
- **Address Potential New Issues:** If the build fails due to non-existent assumed `.cpp` files or new errors, these will need to be addressed.
- **`AdvancedMCTSBot` Functional Testing:** Once a clean build is achieved, perform basic runtime tests.

## Status

- **Current Phase:** Build System Correction & Verification for `AdvancedMCTSBot`.
- **Immediate Next Action:** Attempting to build `AdvancedMCTSBot` after `CMakeLists.txt` modifications.
- **Confidence:** High that compilation errors are fixed. Medium that linker errors are fixed (dependent on existence of assumed `.cpp` files).
