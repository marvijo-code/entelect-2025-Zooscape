# Active Context

## Current Project Focus

- **Project:** `AdvancedMCTSBot` (C++)
- **Objective:** Achieve a clean build by resolving all compilation and linker errors.

## Current Work & Status

- **Task:** Fixing build errors for `AdvancedMCTSBot`.
- **Progress:**
    - Resolved multiple C++ compilation errors (C2248, C2679, C2512, C2601, C1075) in `Bot.cpp` and `GameState.h` related to member access, vector usage, `std::optional` for `signalr::hub_connection`, and brace mismatches.
    - Addressed linker errors (LNK2019, LNK2001, LNK1120) by correcting `CMakeLists.txt` to include necessary `.cpp` source files (`GameState.cpp`, `MCTSEngine.cpp`, `MctsService.cpp`, etc.) and remove header files from the `add_executable` target.
    - A new memory (`MEMORY[42a0c912-c442-433f-9f9b-7336252a27fe]`) was created detailing C++ linker error debugging with CMake.

## Recent Changes Summary

- **`Bot.h`:** Changed `signalr::hub_connection connection;` to `std::optional<signalr::hub_connection> connection;` and added `#include <optional>`.
- **`Bot.cpp`:**
    - Updated `connection` initialization to use `emplace`.
    - Updated all usages of `connection` to use `->` operator with `if (connection)` checks.
    - Fixed vector usage for `animals` and `zookeepers` (from index assignment to `push_back`).
    - Corrected a brace mismatch in the `Bot::Bot()` constructor.
- **`GameState.h`:** Moved `wallBoard`, `pelletBoard`, `powerUpBoard` to public section.
- **`CMakeLists.txt`:** Modified `add_executable` to correctly list `.cpp` source files and remove `.h` files. Added `GameState.cpp`, `MCTSEngine.cpp`, `MctsService.cpp`, and tentatively `Heuristics.cpp`, `MCTSNode.cpp`, `SignalRClient.cpp`.

## Next Steps

1.  **Run Build:** Execute the build command: `cmake --build build --preset x64-debug > terminal.log 2>&1` in `c:\dev\2025-Zooscape\Bots\AdvancedMCTSBot`.
2.  **Analyze `terminal.log`:**
    *   **Success:** If the build is clean (exit code 0, no errors in log), the primary objective is complete. Consider further testing or next development tasks for the bot.
    *   **CMake Configuration Error:** If CMake fails (e.g., due to non-existent assumed `.cpp` files like `Heuristics.cpp`), adjust `CMakeLists.txt` to remove the non-existent files and re-run the build.
    *   **New Compilation/Linker Errors:** If new errors appear, diagnose and fix them, updating this context accordingly.
3.  **Verify Bot Functionality:** (Post-successful build) Basic runtime tests to ensure the bot connects and operates as expected.
