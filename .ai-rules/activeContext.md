# Active Context: Functional Testing & Heuristic Debugging - RESOLVED ✅

## Task Status: COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY ✅

**CRITICAL DEBUG SESSION RESOLVED:** Fixed ClingyHeuroBot2's LineOfSightPelletsHeuristic that was causing multiple test failures.

## Problem Summary
1. **Initial Issue:** GameState12 test failed - bot chose Down instead of Up
2. **Our Fix:** Rewrote LineOfSightPelletsHeuristic but broke 2 other tests
3. **Root Cause Found:** Heuristic was giving completely backwards results (14.5 pellets Left vs 1 pellet Up, when it should be 2 pellets each)

## Final Solution ✅
**Key Issues Fixed:**
1. **Wrong Starting Position:** Was counting from current position instead of new position after move
2. **Incorrect Stop Condition:** Was only stopping at walls, not at any non-pellet content
3. **Logic Error:** The combination caused massive over-counting in some directions

**Final Working Logic:**
- Count pellets from the **new position** (where bot will be after move)
- Count in the **direction of movement**
- Stop at **any non-pellet content** (not just walls)
- This matches GameStateInspector's "consecutive pellets" calculation

## Test Results - ALL PASSING ✅
- ✅ **GameState12ClingyHeuroBot2MustMoveUp** - PASSES (original issue fixed)
- ✅ **ChaseMorePelletGroups** - PASSES (was failing, now fixed)
- ✅ **ChaseImmediatePellet_LeftOrDown_EvenWhenChased** - PASSES (was failing, now fixed)

## Key Learning
The LineOfSightPelletsHeuristic should count **consecutive pellets in line of sight** from the position the bot will move to, not complex linked pellet analysis. The GameStateInspector's `CountConsecutivePellets` function was the correct reference implementation.

## Final Implementation
**File:** `Bots/ClingyHeuroBot2/Heuristics/LineOfSightPelletsHeuristic.cs`
- Counts from `MyNewPosition` (where bot will be after move)
- Uses simple while loop until hitting non-pellet content
- Clean, efficient implementation matching game inspector logic

## Status: READY FOR NEXT TASK
The LineOfSightPelletsHeuristic is now working correctly and all related tests are passing. Debug session complete.

## Debug Evidence from Test Logs
**GameState 162 (ChaseMorePelletGroups):**
- **Expected:** Up movement
- **Bot chose:** Left (score: 1610.5692) 
- **Up score:** 262.7025
- **Critical Issue:** LineOfSightPellets giving Left=1,450.00 points vs Up=100.00 points
- **Game Inspector shows:** Up has 23 linked pellets, Left has only 2 linked pellets
- **This is BACKWARDS - our heuristic is completely wrong!**

## Heuristic Implementation Status
**File:** `Bots/ClingyHeuroBot2/Heuristics/LineOfSightPelletsHeuristic.cs`
**Current Logic:** Counts pellets in direction of movement from current position until wall/boundary
**Debug Logging:** Added `Log.Information` statements (messages ARE in logs but need careful parsing)

## Key Debugging Insights
1. **Heuristic gives 14.5 pellets Left vs 1 pellet Up** (from scores: 1450/100 = 14.5, 100/100 = 1)
2. **Game Inspector shows opposite:** Up=23 pellets, Left=2 pellets  
3. **Logic Error:** Our direction calculation or pellet counting is fundamentally broken
4. **Debug messages exist** in test output but require careful extraction

## Next Debug Steps (Resume Here)
1. **Extract debug messages** from test logs to see actual pellet counts being calculated
2. **Verify direction calculation** - ensure Up/Down/Left/Right are mapped correctly
3. **Test pellet counting logic** - manually verify cells being checked match expected direction
4. **Consider coordinate system** - check if Y-axis is inverted or coordinate mapping is wrong
5. **Fix the core logic error** causing backwards pellet counting

## Game Inspector Analysis (Working Tool)
**GameState 162 Analysis:**
- Bot at position (40,47)
- Immediate pellets: Up=Yes, Left=Yes, Right=No, Down=No
- Total linked pellets: Up=23, Left=2, Right=0, Down=0
- **Test expects Up (correct based on pellet count)**

## Commands for Resume
```bash
# Run failing test with full logs
dotnet test FunctionalTests/FunctionalTests.csproj --filter "ChaseMorePelletGroups" --logger "console;verbosity=detailed"

# Analyze game state
cd tools/GameStateInspector && dotnet run -- ../../FunctionalTests/bin/Debug/net8.0/GameStates/162.json "ClingyHeuroBot2"

# Search for debug messages in logs
dotnet test --filter "ChaseMorePelletGroups" | findstr "DEBUG"
```

## Files with Debug Code
- `Bots/ClingyHeuroBot2/Heuristics/LineOfSightPelletsHeuristic.cs` - Has debug logging added
- `tools/GameStateInspector/Program.cs` - Working analysis tool
- `FunctionalTests/StandardBotTests.cs` - Test definitions

## Critical Fix Needed
The LineOfSightPelletsHeuristic is giving completely backwards results. Need to identify if the issue is:
- Direction mapping (Up/Down/Left/Right confusion)
- Coordinate system (X/Y axis confusion) 
- Pellet counting logic (wrong cells being checked)
- Weight calculation error
