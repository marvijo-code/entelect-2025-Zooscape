# Active Context

**Primary Goal:** Resolve C++ compiler warnings and fix multi-threading issues in the `AdvancedMCTSBot`.

**Recent Work Summary:**

1.  **Resolved C++ Test Failure:** Successfully debugged and fixed the `AdvancedMCTSBot_SmokeTest34` functional test.
    -   **Problem:** The test was failing at runtime because the bot nickname ("AdvancedMCTSBot") hardcoded in `Test34.cpp` was not present in the `34.json` game state file.
    -   **Investigation:**
        -   Confirmed the valid nicknames in `34.json` were "ClingyHeuroBot" and "ClingyHeuroBot2".
        -   Diagnosed and fixed several build system issues in `CMakeLists.txt` that prevented the test executable from being built or run correctly.
    -   **Resolution:** Updated `Test34.cpp` to use the correct nickname ("ClingyHeuroBot2"), which resolved the test failure.

2.  **Current Focus:** Address C++ compiler warnings.
    -   **Problem:** The build process is not displaying the `C4244` and `C4267` data conversion warnings, preventing diagnosis.
    -   **Current Strategy:** Modified `CMakeLists.txt` to treat these specific warnings as errors (`/we4244`, `/we4267`) to force the build to fail and reveal their locations.

**Next Immediate Step:**
- Re-run the build with the new compiler flags to identify the exact source of the warnings.

## Current Project Focus

- **Project:** `AdvancedMCTSBot` (C++)
- **Objective:** Achieve a clean build by resolving all compilation and linker errors.

## Current Work & Status

- **Task:** Fixing build errors for `AdvancedMCTSBot`.
- **Progress:**
    - Resolved multiple C++ compilation errors (C2248, C2679, C2512, C2601, C1075) in `Bot.cpp` and `GameState.h` related to member access, vector usage, `std::optional` for `signalr::hub_connection`, and brace mismatches.
    - Addressed linker errors (LNK2019, LNK2001, LNK1120) by correcting `CMakeLists.txt` to include necessary `.cpp` source files (`GameState.cpp`, `MCTSEngine.cpp`, `MctsService.cpp`, etc.) and remove header files from the `add_executable` target.
    - A new memory (`MEMORY[42a0c912-c442-433f-9f9b-7336252a27fe]`) was created detailing C++ linker error debugging with CMake.

## Recent Changes Summary

- **`Bot.h`:** Changed `signalr::hub_connection connection;` to `std::optional<signalr::hub_connection> connection;` and added `#include <optional>`.
- **`Bot.cpp`:**
    - Updated `connection` initialization to use `emplace`.
    - Updated all usages of `connection` to use `->` operator with `if (connection)` checks.
    - Fixed vector usage for `animals` and `zookeepers` (from index assignment to `push_back`).
    - Corrected a brace mismatch in the `Bot::Bot()` constructor.
- **`GameState.h`:** Moved `wallBoard`, `pelletBoard`, `powerUpBoard` to public section.
- **`CMakeLists.txt`:** Modified `add_executable` to correctly list `.cpp` source files and remove `.h` files. Added `GameState.cpp`, `MCTSEngine.cpp`, `MctsService.cpp`, and tentatively `Heuristics.cpp`, `MCTSNode.cpp`, `SignalRClient.cpp`.

## Next Steps

1.  **Run Build:** Execute the build command: `cmake --build build --preset x64-debug > terminal.log 2>&1` in `c:\dev\2025-Zooscape\Bots\AdvancedMCTSBot`.
2.  **Analyze `terminal.log`:**
    *   **Success:** If the build is clean (exit code 0, no errors in log), the primary objective is complete. Consider further testing or next development tasks for the bot.
    *   **CMake Configuration Error:** If CMake fails (e.g., due to non-existent assumed `.cpp` files like `Heuristics.cpp`), adjust `CMakeLists.txt` to remove the non-existent files and re-run the build.
    *   **New Compilation/Linker Errors:** If new errors appear, diagnose and fix them, updating this context accordingly.
3.  **Verify Bot Functionality:** (Post-successful build) Basic runtime tests to ensure the bot connects and operates as expected.
