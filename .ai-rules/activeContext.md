# Active Context: ZooscapeRunner Build Resolution

## Current Task
Resolve compilation errors in the `ZooscapeRunner` Uno Platform project. The build is failing after an attempt to resolve a `CS0433` ambiguous reference error by using an `extern alias`.

## Recent Changes
1.  **`extern alias` Implementation:**
    *   The `Uno.WinUI` package in `ZooscapeRunner.csproj` was aliased as `UnoSdk`.
    *   The `extern alias UnoSdk;` directive was added to the top of `App.cs`.
    *   The `SuspendingEventArgs` type in `App.cs` was updated to `UnoSdk::Windows.ApplicationModel.SuspendingEventArgs`.

2.  **New Errors Encountered:**
    *   The `extern alias` fixed the original `CS0433` error but introduced a cascade of `CS0234` and `CS0246` errors (e.g., "The type or namespace name 'Controls' does not exist in the namespace 'Microsoft.UI.Xaml'"). This is because all types from the aliased `Uno.WinUI` assembly are now hidden.

## Current Blocker
The build is broken due to the new compilation errors. To fix this, `using` aliases must be added to all affected C# files (`App.cs`, `MainPage.xaml.cs`, etc.) to map the required types from the `UnoSdk` alias.

For example: `using Application = UnoSdk::Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Application;`

## Next Steps
1.  **Correct `App.cs`:** The user has provided the current content of `App.cs`. The file needs to be completely rewritten with the correct `extern alias` and a full set of `using` aliases for all required types.
2.  **Request `MainPage.xaml.cs`:** Obtain the full content of `MainPage.xaml.cs` from the user.
3.  **Correct `MainPage.xaml.cs`:** Rewrite the file with the necessary `using` aliases.
4.  **Build and Verify:** Run the build script (`run-ZooscapeRunner.bat`) to confirm all compilation errors are resolved and the application builds successfully.

**Primary Goal:** Ensure the `AdvancedMCTSBot` is a fully functional and effective game-playing agent.

**Recent Work Summary:**

The bot was previously unable to send valid commands to the server due to a complex serialization issue between the C++ client and the C# server. Prior to that, MCTS expansion was blocked by issues in game state parsing and logic.

1.  **Command Sending Fix (SignalR C++/C# Serialization):**
    *   **Problem:** The server consistently received "Invalid command (0)" or no command at all.
    *   **Investigation:** Compared the C++ bot's payload with the working C# `ClingyHeuroBot2`.
    *   **Solution:** The C# server expects a single JSON object with a key named `"Action"` (PascalCase). The value for this key is the integer representation of the `BotAction` enum, cast to a `double` in C++ when creating the `signalr::value`.
    *   **Implementation:** Modified `Bot.cpp` to send `std::map<std::string, signalr::value> cmdMap; cmdMap["Action"] = signalr::value(static_cast<double>(action_enum_value));` as the sole argument to `connection->send("BotCommand", ...)`. This resolved the command sending issue, and the bot is now moving.

2.  **MCTS Expansion Fixes (Prerequisite to Command Sending):**
    *   **Connection Stability:** Implemented a connection retry loop in `Bot::run()`.
    *   **JSON Game State Parsing:**
        *   **Key Casing:** Corrected parsing logic in `Bot.cpp` to use lowercase keys (e.g., `"cells"`, `"animals"`) due to SignalR C++ client behavior.
        *   **Grid Dimensions:** Implemented a two-pass system to calculate grid dimensions from `cells` data.
    *   **Game Logic Correction:**
        *   **Obstacle Detection:** Corrected `GameState::isTraversable` to use the populated `wallBoard`.

**Next Immediate Step:**

- Thoroughly test and observe the `AdvancedMCTSBot`'s gameplay to ensure it makes reasonable moves, operates within the 200ms time limit per move, and plays effectively.
- Identify and address any remaining bugs or performance issues in its decision-making process.
