# Active Context

**Primary Goal:** Ensure the `AdvancedMCTSBot` is a fully functional and effective game-playing agent.

**Recent Work Summary:**

The bot was previously unable to send valid commands to the server due to a complex serialization issue between the C++ client and the C# server. Prior to that, MCTS expansion was blocked by issues in game state parsing and logic.

1.  **Command Sending Fix (SignalR C++/C# Serialization):**
    *   **Problem:** The server consistently received "Invalid command (0)" or no command at all.
    *   **Investigation:** Compared the C++ bot's payload with the working C# `ClingyHeuroBot2`.
    *   **Solution:** The C# server expects a single JSON object with a key named `"Action"` (PascalCase). The value for this key is the integer representation of the `BotAction` enum, cast to a `double` in C++ when creating the `signalr::value`.
    *   **Implementation:** Modified `Bot.cpp` to send `std::map<std::string, signalr::value> cmdMap; cmdMap["Action"] = signalr::value(static_cast<double>(action_enum_value));` as the sole argument to `connection->send("BotCommand", ...)`. This resolved the command sending issue, and the bot is now moving.

2.  **MCTS Expansion Fixes (Prerequisite to Command Sending):**
    *   **Connection Stability:** Implemented a connection retry loop in `Bot::run()`.
    *   **JSON Game State Parsing:**
        *   **Key Casing:** Corrected parsing logic in `Bot.cpp` to use lowercase keys (e.g., `"cells"`, `"animals"`) due to SignalR C++ client behavior.
        *   **Grid Dimensions:** Implemented a two-pass system to calculate grid dimensions from `cells` data.
    *   **Game Logic Correction:**
        *   **Obstacle Detection:** Corrected `GameState::isTraversable` to use the populated `wallBoard`.

**Next Immediate Step:**

- Thoroughly test and observe the `AdvancedMCTSBot`'s gameplay to ensure it makes reasonable moves, operates within the 200ms time limit per move, and plays effectively.
- Identify and address any remaining bugs or performance issues in its decision-making process.
