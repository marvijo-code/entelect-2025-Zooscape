# AdvancedMCTSBot Analysis - Poor Performance Issues

## Problem Summary
The AdvancedMCTSBot is not performing well despite using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), which should theoretically provide strong gameplay. The bot exhibits:

1. **Poor pellet collection efficiency** - Not taking available pellets
2. **Frequent captures by zookeepers** - Poor survival instincts
3. **Suboptimal move selection** - Making questionable decisions

## Log Analysis from Recent Match

### Performance Issues Observed:
- **T3 Timeout Risk**: 204.756ms response time (exceeds 180ms threshold)
- **Slow pellet collection**: 5 ticks to collect first pellet (T6)
- **Early game inefficiency**: Multiple moves without pellet collection (T1-T5)

### Move Sequence Analysis:
```
T1 (4,4) Up 124ms 0pts     - No pellet collected
T2 (4,4) Left 23ms 0pts    - No movement/pellet
T3 (4,4) Up 5ms 0pts       - Timeout risk, no pellet
T4 (4,3) Right 10ms 0pts   - Moving but no pellet
T5 (5,3) Right 22ms 0pts   - Still no pellet
T6 (6,3) Right 110ms 64pts - FIRST pellet at T6!
```

## Root Cause Hypotheses

### 1. Simulation Policy Issues
- `selectSimulationAction()` may have poor heuristic balance
- Pellet collection rewards might be insufficient vs other factors
- Random noise in simulation might override good moves

### 2. Expansion Strategy Problems
- Node expansion might not prioritize promising moves
- Transposition table usage could be merging dissimilar states
- Immediate reward shaping in expansion might be counterproductive

### 3. Selection/UCB Issues
- UCB exploration constant might be too high/low
- Virtual loss implementation might bias against good moves
- AMAF integration could be providing misleading signals

### 4. Heuristics Engine Problems
- Heuristic weights might be poorly balanced
- Evaluation function might not properly assess pellet opportunities
- Zookeeper avoidance might be too conservative

### 5. Time Management Issues
- 120ms time limit might be too restrictive for quality search
- Early iterations might not provide sufficient exploration
- Multi-threading coordination might cause inefficiencies

## Files Requiring Deep Analysis

### Core MCTS Implementation:
- `MCTSEngine.cpp` - Main search loop, selection, expansion, simulation
- `MCTSNode.cpp` - Node management, UCB calculation, statistics
- `MCTSNode.h` - Node structure and threading support

### Game Logic:
- `GameState.cpp/h` - State representation and action application
- `Bot.cpp` - SignalR integration and state conversion

### Heuristics:
- `Heuristics.cpp/h` - Evaluation functions and move scoring
- `HeuristicsEngine` - Heuristic coordination and weighting

### Configuration:
- Bot configuration (time limits, iterations, threads)
- Heuristic weights and parameters

## Investigation Plan

1. **Simulation Policy Analysis**: Review `selectSimulationAction()` logic
2. **Reward Structure Review**: Examine pellet collection incentives
3. **UCB Parameter Tuning**: Analyze exploration vs exploitation balance
4. **Heuristic Weight Analysis**: Check if survival vs pellet collection is balanced
5. **Performance Profiling**: Identify computational bottlenecks
6. **State Representation Validation**: Ensure game state accuracy

## Expected Outcomes
- Identify specific algorithmic weaknesses
- Implement targeted fixes for pellet collection
- Improve zookeeper avoidance without over-conservatism
- Optimize time usage for better decision quality
- Validate fixes through testing and match analysis

## Next Steps
1. Systematic file-by-file code review
2. Identify and document specific bugs/weaknesses
3. Implement fixes with proper testing
4. Performance validation through match logs
