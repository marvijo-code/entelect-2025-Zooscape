# GatherNear Bot Integration Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the heuristics and strategies successfully adapted from the GatherNear.13-SEP-2024.King bot (from Sproutopia 2024) to the ClingyHeuroBot2 for Zooscape 2025.

## Key Heuristics Implemented

### 1. **MoveIfIdle** (Weight: 3.0)
- **Origin**: GatherNear's `MoveIfIdle = 50` heuristic
- **Adaptation**: Encourages movement when the bot has no queued actions
- **Zooscape Application**: Prevents the bot from staying idle, ensuring continuous pellet collection
- **Implementation**: Simplified due to different queue system, but maintains the core concept

### 2. **ChangeDirectionWhenStuck** (Weight: 2.5)
- **Origin**: GatherNear's `ChangeDirectionWhenStuckBonus = 60` heuristic
- **Adaptation**: Detects when the bot is in a constrained area with limited movement options
- **Zooscape Application**: Helps navigate maze-like structures and avoid getting trapped against walls
- **Implementation**: Analyzes blocked directions and rewards valid escape moves

### 3. **ShortestPathToGoal** (Weight: 1.8)
- **Origin**: Based on Sproutopia's A* pathfinding system (`ShortestPathFinder.cs`)
- **Adaptation**: Simplified pathfinding that prioritizes moves toward nearest pellets
- **Zooscape Application**: Efficient pellet collection by reducing Manhattan distance to targets
- **Implementation**: Uses distance reduction heuristic for computational efficiency

### 4. **EdgeAwareness** (Weight: 0.7)
- **Origin**: GatherNear's edge detection and `MoveToEdgePenalty` concepts
- **Adaptation**: Penalizes movements too close to map boundaries
- **Zooscape Application**: Prevents the bot from getting trapped in corners where escape routes are limited
- **Implementation**: Calculates distance to nearest edge and applies graduated penalties

### 5. **UnoccupiedCellBonus** (Weight: 1.0)
- **Origin**: Sproutopia's `MoveTowardsUnoccupiedCellBonus` and exploration heuristics
- **Adaptation**: Rewards movement to areas with more open neighboring cells
- **Zooscape Application**: Maintains mobility options and avoids congested areas
- **Implementation**: Counts empty neighboring cells around target position

### 6. **OpponentTrailChasing** (Weight: 0.5)
- **Origin**: GatherNear's `MoveTowardsOpponentTrailBonus` and opponent tracking
- **Adaptation**: Mild bonus for following opponents at safe distances
- **Zooscape Application**: Potentially benefits from opponent movements while avoiding zookeeper risks
- **Implementation**: Tracks nearest opponents and rewards safe pursuit

### 7. **CenterDistanceBonus** (Weight: 0.4)
- **Origin**: Sproutopia's `MoveToCenterBonus` heuristic
- **Adaptation**: Small bias towards staying reasonably close to map center
- **Zooscape Application**: Takes advantage of map symmetry for efficient pellet access
- **Implementation**: Calculates distance to map center with balanced scoring

### 8. **MovementConsistency** (Weight: 0.8)
- **Origin**: Derived from Sproutopia's anti-oscillation and directional consistency patterns
- **Adaptation**: Uses position history to infer movement direction and encourage consistency
- **Zooscape Application**: Reduces wasteful back-and-forth movements
- **Implementation**: Leverages the existing `_recentPositions` tracking system

### 9. **TunnelNavigation** (Weight: 1.2)
- **Origin**: Maze navigation concepts from Sproutopia's pathfinding algorithms
- **Adaptation**: Detects narrow passages and provides navigation bonuses
- **Zooscape Application**: Efficient navigation through tight maze corridors
- **Implementation**: Counts traversable neighbors to identify tunnel-like areas

### 10. **EarlyGameZookeeperAvoidance** (Weight: 4.0)
- **Origin**: Custom addition based on Zooscape's specific game start mechanics
- **Adaptation**: Prioritizes moving away from map center during first 10 ticks
- **Zooscape Application**: Critical early survival since zookeeper starts in center
- **Implementation**: Calculates distance from center and heavily rewards escape moves

## Territory Control Inspired Heuristics

### 11. **PelletAreaControl** (Weight: 1.6)
- **Origin**: Sproutopia's territory claiming and area control mechanisms
- **Adaptation**: Controls areas with high pellet density
- **Zooscape Application**: Maximizes pellet collection efficiency by dominating productive regions
- **Implementation**: Radius-based pellet counting around target positions

### 12. **DensityMapping** (Weight: 1.3)
- **Origin**: Territory value calculation from Sproutopia's `CalculateTerritoryGain`
- **Adaptation**: Maps and prioritizes high-density pellet areas
- **Zooscape Application**: Strategic positioning in the most rewarding map areas
- **Implementation**: Calculates pellet density per unit area

### 13. **CornerControl** (Weight: 0.9)
- **Origin**: Sproutopia's corner strategies (`MoveToUnvisitedCornerBonus`)
- **Adaptation**: Strategic control of map corners when they contain pellets
- **Zooscape Application**: Leverages corner areas that may be less contested
- **Implementation**: Identifies corner proximity and evaluates pellet presence

### 14. **AdaptivePathfinding** (Weight: 1.1)
- **Origin**: Dynamic strategy adjustment from Sproutopia's game phase recognition
- **Adaptation**: Changes strategy based on remaining pellets and opponent count
- **Zooscape Application**: Adapts from exploration to aggressive collection as game progresses
- **Implementation**: Three-phase strategy (early/mid/endgame) based on pellet count

## Key Adaptations Made

### Game Mechanics Differences
1. **No Territory System**: Adapted territory control concepts to pellet area domination
2. **No Trail System**: Removed trail-specific heuristics, focused on position-based strategies
3. **Zookeeper Threat**: Integrated existing zookeeper avoidance with GatherNear's opponent tracking
4. **Symmetric Maps**: Leveraged Sproutopia's center-bias strategies for Zooscape's symmetric design

### Technical Adaptations
1. **Simplified Pathfinding**: Used Manhattan distance instead of full A* for performance
2. **Position History**: Leveraged existing `_recentPositions` system for consistency tracking
3. **Enum Compatibility**: Adapted BotAction enum differences (Up/Down vs UP/DOWN)
4. **Property Availability**: Worked around different Animal class properties

### Weight Tuning
- Adjusted weights to be compatible with existing ClingyHeuroBot2 scoring system
- Balanced new heuristics with existing sophisticated Zooscape-specific strategies
- Ensured GatherNear concepts complement rather than override specialized zookeeper avoidance

## Integration Results

The integration successfully brings proven maze navigation and area control strategies from the Sproutopia champion GatherNear bot to Zooscape, while maintaining the bot's existing sophisticated understanding of Zooscape-specific mechanics like zookeeper behavior, capture avoidance, and pellet competition dynamics.

These heuristics should improve:
- **Navigation Efficiency**: Better pathfinding and maze traversal
- **Area Control**: Strategic domination of high-value pellet regions  
- **Movement Quality**: Reduced oscillation and better directional consistency
- **Adaptability**: Dynamic strategy adjustment based on game state
- **Spatial Awareness**: Better understanding of map topology and positioning

The implementation maintains computational efficiency while adding robust navigation capabilities proven in competitive AI environments.
