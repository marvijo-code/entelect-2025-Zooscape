# Entelect Challenge 2025 - Zooscape 🦏

Zooscape is the Entelect Challenge game for 2025.\
Participants are required to code bots to simulate escaped zoo animals in a virtual world. These animals are chased by zookeepers trying to return them to their enclosures.\
While avoiding the zookeepers, the animals aim to collect as many food pellets and power-ups (coming soon) as possible to achieve a high score.

## Visualiser

### Download

- [Linux](https://github.com/EntelectChallenge/2025-Zooscape/releases/latest/download/visualiser-linux.zip)
- [macOS](http://github.com/EntelectChallenge/2025-Zooscape/releases/latest/download/visualiser-macos.zip)
- [Windows](http://github.com/EntelectChallenge/2025-Zooscape/releases/latest/download/visualiser-windows.zip)


### Usage

When your game engine is running, simply run the visualiser executable, and it will automatically connect and start
visualising the game state.

> [!WARNING]
> On macOS Sequoia and later, you might need to allow the visualiser to run manually. Please read the following

If, when running the visualiser you see a prompt that looks like this

![Screenshot of macOS warning popup](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0ed19e64-788a-440b-b955-c3afd6d1f9f2)

Click "Done", then navigate to System Settings > Privacy & Security, and near the bottom of the screen you should see something
that looks like the following

![Screenshot of macOS system settings](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4fe05f33-8dc5-47e9-b02c-cc290c505a56)

Click "Open anyway" and the visualiser should open. If you move or rename the file, you might need to do this process again.

## Project Structure

In this project you will find everything we use to build a starter pack that will assist you to run a bot on your local machine. which comprises of the following:

1. **Zooscape** - The engine enforces the game's rules by applying the bot commands to the game state if they are valid.
2. **ReferenceBot** - A bot that can be played against to test your own bot
3. **StarterBots** - Starter bots with limited logic that can be used as a starting point for your bot.
4. **PlayableBot** - A bot that can manually controlled by the player

This project can be used to get a better understanding of the rules and to help debug your bot.

Improvements and enhancements will be made to the game engine code over time.

The game engine is available to the community for peer review and bug fixes. If you find any bugs or have any concerns, please [e-mail us](mailto:challenge@entelect.co.za) or discuss it with us on the [forum](http://forum.entelect.co.za/).
