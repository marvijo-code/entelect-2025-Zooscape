  "instructions": [
    "Do not ask unnecessary questions; automate the workflow unless clarification is absolutely required.",
    "Select random log files from the logs directory.",
    "Use the GameAnalyzer tool in tools/ to analyze each state file.",
    "Identify and copy only 'interesting' states (e.g., close to enemies, difficult choices) as JSON test files.",
    "Run each state through GameAnalyzer.",
    "Compare ClingyHeuroBot's action with the analysis and logic output.",
    "Add the test only if the bot's action disagrees with the analysis.",
    "Always use the paths in .ai-rules/important-file-paths.md.",
    "Build the project after changes to verify no errors."
